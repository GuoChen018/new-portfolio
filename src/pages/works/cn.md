<!-- CONTEXT -->

#### Context

## What is Creator Now and a clan?

Creator Now is a paid community for creators to connect with others, sharpen their skills, and get personalized feedback.

In Creator Now, a clan is a group of creators with similar niche / interests (max 20 people). A creator can either start or join a clan. And the one who starts a clan is the clan leader.

<!-- PROBLEM -->

#### Problem

## It was hard for clan leaders to manage and grow their clan

Let’s break down the problems a bit more. The three biggest problems the team discovered during the research phase were as follows:

### 1 - No guidance

Clan leaders had zero guidance on how to build a clan.

### 2 - Hard to keep track of new applicants

Applicants apply by sending an automated message to the clan leaders. It was an absolute hassle for clan leaders to keep track.

### 3 - Hard to discover new members

There was no easy way for clan leaders to find new members and invite them.

<!-- SOLUTION -->

#### Solution

## Clans v2 - A simple and helpful clan management system

### Check out our onboarding guide as a clan leader

Creating a clan takes a lot of work. Let us help you

### Easily keep track of new applicants

No more tracking messages. Track it all on your admin page.

### Discover new members to invite to the clan

Get recommendations of new members that may be a fit.

#### Contribution

## Solo design ownership over the project

I worked with a full-stack engineer, PM, and the head of community to redesign the clan leader admin page.

#### Result

## Shipped & Used by 100+ clan leaders

All of my designs were shipped in February 2023. It’s now being used by over 100+ clan creators.

#### Process

## Let's walk over what I did

### Understand the problem

At the time, the team had a relatively strong conviction around starting a project to help clan leaders. They had some ideas, but they weren’t confirmed.

So, I conducted 5 interviews with clan leaders and discovered these key areas where we could improve.

#### Lack of guidance

There was a lack of guidance when a leader created a clan for the first time.

#### Ineffective applicant management

It was a hassle for leaders to sort through all the application messages.

#### Poor discoverability

It was hard for leaders to find suitable clan members.

### Explore designs

Based on the insights, I generated a bunch of possible solutions for each problem. I had multiple async + sync discussion w PM. Ended up with these. Note: one of the important decisions was to help with the clan leaders in the less engaged clans since the majority of the clans don’t have 20 members (max).

#### Lack of guidance

### Validate the solutions

Due to the time constraint, most of the validation was internal. However, after we shipped the feature, I did message the clan leaders I interviewed, and all of them loved clans v2!

<!-- Learnings -->

#### Learnings

## What I learned

### Prioritization

It’s exciting to solve problems. But it’s also important to prioritize which ones are the most pressing problems. In our case, we decided to focus on the less engaged users and went from there.

### Importance of speed

Speed is everything in a startup. Embrace the constraint and deliver.

#### If next time

## I should have...

### Set up clear success metric & track

I would have either sent out a survey to all the clan leaders at the time to validate my solutions even more. Or I should have scheduled some calls with clan leaders. Even more, I should have set up analytics on Amplitude to track clan leader’s behavior.

### Worked more closely with Head of Community

I should have talked to the head of community more as she has a ton of experience talking to creators.
